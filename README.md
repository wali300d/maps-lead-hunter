| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Name** | Business name |
| **Phone** | Phone number (or N/A) |
| **Maps Link** | Direct Google Maps URL |

## ⚙️ How It Works

- A **content script** runs on Google Maps pages
- When you start scraping, it watches the results panel for listing cards
- Each card is clicked to open its detail panel
- The script checks if a **"Website" button** exists
- If **no website** → the business is saved as a lead
- Results persist while the tab is open; export before closing

## 💡 Tips

- Search specific niches: `"hair salons in Islamabad"` gives cleaner results
- Scroll the **left panel** slowly — new cards load lazily
- The 400ms delay between cards keeps it polite and avoids rate-limiting
- Run multiple searches and merge your CSVs

## ⚠️ Notes

- For personal/research use only — respect Google's Terms of Service
- Results are stored in memory; always export before closing the tab
- Works best with a stable internet connection
